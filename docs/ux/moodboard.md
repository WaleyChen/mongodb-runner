- The get shit done database.
- Give people a playground and they’ll figure out how to make the awesome things they actually want.
- The craziest demo of a database you’ll ever see:
  - open mongoscope
  - paste in a url to a data stream
  - transform, store, and run a realtime aggregation on incoming data
  - write result stream on a web socket back to mongoscope
  - script on mongoscope client processing incoming data from web socket and visualizing it
