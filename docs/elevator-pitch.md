## `mongoscope`: a UI to explore and administer MongoDB

Chartered as a utility-belt for developers, administrators, and mad
scientists, `mongoscope` is the way we hope everyone interacts with
MongoDB directly; run it on a laptop to browse the results of your
experiments, debug and fix schema issues before the alarms sound, or run
it on AWS for a secure and complete administration tool the whole team
can use.

### intern/recruiting snippet

Currently in alpha, there are many ways for individual contributors to
have a big impact on shaping the user-experience and technical
challenges.  The interesting and exciting problems vary widely; from
researching and prototyping new ways to visualize how data moves through
100’s of nodes, to working with the Kernel Team to architect and
implement new features in MongoDB itself.

This project is ideal for those interested in:

- metadata and systems visualization
- client and server javascript
- open data and processing
- user experience design and research
