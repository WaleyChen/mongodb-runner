## ux

micro-framework for thinking about how to tackle this product and remove bias:

- [`Persona`][persona] _who_ are we targeting? context of personality and skill
- [`Task`][task] _what_ a [`Persona`][persona] is trying to accomplish
- [`Scenario`][scenario] _why_ and _when_ this [`Persona`][persona] is trying to
  accomplish this [`Task`][task]
- `Goal` = `Persona` + `Task` + `Scenario` _how_ mongoscope provides value

 > _@note_ need to solidify thoughts below a bit more to provide more context

- important to build and stick by the [`Taxonomy`][taxonomy]

- priority for UX on mongoscope is to materialize and prioritize
  as many goals as possible

- creating and maintaining the process and framework for expanding the number of
  users mongoscope provides value for

- one JIRA User Story can easily apply to more than one Goal

- trying to create an anthology of who/what/when/why/how that is a reference
  for priority or implementation, rather than having to meet/email/debate and
  even worse, be surprised when something is delivered

- no one right answer for any Goal; only matters whether the Task is achieved

- allows for plenty of room for innovative solutions that would not have been
  included in an official Product Requirements Document or Axure Mock-Up
