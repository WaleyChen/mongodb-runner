# visualization

## top data

- creek view (120-60 seconds)
    - because stream/streaming/etc means something in code
    - 1 stat per second, stacked vertically for easy comparison
    - just show database level?
    - filter back to narrow down namespaces you're seeing?
    - having `total.lock.count/total.count * 100` would be nice, like the EKG
        brainstorm
- shift view (15-10 minutes)
    - quick way to see if i actually broke something

## acl's

- ACL's are just logic circuits, so why not visualize them the same way?
- [jointjs logic circuit](http://www.jointjs.com/demos/logic) has already done a
    lot of the legwork

## connections and cursors

- boids/swarming?
