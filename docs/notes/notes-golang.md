### strengths

- quick prototype was really nice https://gist.github.com/imlucas/4a92e69c86478094bd76
- wouldn't have to do the full node.js standalone executable building
- using it in other places in the company, but that seems to be just for convenience

### weaknesses

- yet another language... which may be a big enough deal breaker on it's own
- still growing
- miss out on a chance for target audience of mongoscope to fall in love with us
- no npm :(
- when will google decide to stop paying rob pike to work on it?

## notes

- [go-socket.io](https://github.com/imlucas/go-socket.io): easily extend to support long polling
    and binary in the protocol, BUT will always be chasing the real deal :(
- [oauth2 provider](https://github.com/martini-contrib/oauth2)
- [acl](https://github.com/martini-contrib/accessflags)
- https://github.com/martini-contrib/sessionauth
- https://github.com/martini-contrib/cors
- https://github.com/martini-contrib/secure
- Include anything in the same binary https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata
