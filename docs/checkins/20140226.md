## recap

- :+1: worked out kinks of app layout, bigger dependencies (like style guidance
    and code sharing with MMS)
- :+1: close on the [sketch punchlist](https://github.com/10gen/mongoscope/blob/master/docs/milestones-sketch.md)
    with basics of:
    - host + build info
    - list databases, collections and indexes
    - global log
    - mongostat/mongotop
- [notes from demo](https://gist.github.com/imlucas/5a1361c1603633cd4a46)
    earlier in the week
- [bootloader](http://10gen.github.io/mongoscope/bootloader.html)
    - :+1: POC [bootloader served from dbwebserver.cpp](https://github.com/imlucas/mongo/commit/1e834cf09ef05accfcc56339d8a01e25e17f4402)
    - :+1: POC [make REST send back CORS headers](https://github.com/imlucas/mongo/commit/0f42425dd36ef1c872241d7d8264cedbc2ab83b8)
    - tldr: bootloader = jam everything into a single html file that pulls the
      app embedded version/checks for updates
- need to consider latest feedback from security team
    ([notes](https://github.com/10gen/mongoscope/blob/master/docs/notes-securityteam.md))
    for logistics of distribution
    - project impact: app as product unhindered, might need to build in buffer
      for the launcher model proposed

## goals for 7 days

- decision on distribution
- finish sketch punchlist
- knock out explore databases, collections and indexes
- break down and start on exploring documents
