# Personas

Fictional personalities that would be using mongoscope.  If we were writing a
novel, these are our characters.

Some questions to ask yourself when defining a Persona:

- how much does this persona know about:
  - mongodb the product?
  - how the app interacts with mongo?
  - mongodb optimization?
- what kind of system is the persona using?
- what is the programming profile of this persona?

Do include:

- as much detail as possible
- use and add to the [`Taxonomy`][taxonomy]
- real world experiences with customers or developers

Don't include:

- specific [`Tasks`][task] or [`Scenarios`][scenario]
- real names

## developer just playing around

 - < 7 days with mongodb
 - heard about MongoDB University
 - just downloaded and installed it
 - has a Wordpress site that uses a lot of jQuery plugins
 - used to editing code in a WYSIWYG textarea from the admin

## operator

- only deal with mongo when I'm on pager duty
- sort of have a run-book for this app, which basically just
  says it uses mongodb
- rather be using bash than a web UI
- using icefox on Fedora with a custom window manager

## MongoDB Inc Kernel or Driver Developer

@todo: build-out

## MongoDB Inc Customer Support Engineer

## Other Ideas

- basic developer (7 - 30 days with mongodb)
- intermediate developer (30 - 90 days with mongodb)
- advanced developer (i've given talks about mongodb at conferences)
- advanced front-end developer who will just dig out the REST calls from the
  chrome console and make their own thing
