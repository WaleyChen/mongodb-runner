# Taxonomy

The [docs style guide][docs-style] has a beautifully detailed and thorough
taxonomy which covers most of the tech taxonomy and it is strongly recommended
you spend some time reviewing it.

A few extensions you've probably noticed elsewhere in the company from the
product and marketing teams:

## mongoscope

Consider synonymous with web admin, webmin, web ui, 28017,
"dbwebserver.cpp", etc.  This is the product you're most likely working on
if your name begins with an "L" and sounds like "mucus".

## operator

- SysAdmin
- DevOps
- SRE
- DBA
- Manages infrastructure MongoDB runs on
- Responsible for keeping MongoDB up and running

## experience

from MongoDB University registration form:

> What is your experience level with MongoDB?

- Evaluation
- Development
- Production
- Just Playing Around!
